# team31-week-1
So, just to reiterate what @Saratu Muazu Bello [BE] had explained:
The edutech is like an online School platform.
We are building a system, it's not going to be easy, but we have to make it easy,
The system will permit at most four users; Admin, Student, Teachers, and Guardian/Parent. An outsider will have to sign up irrespective but can read and check the home page and about us sections.
The admin is just an overseer, preferably the management.
The teachers, students, and guardians, will need to sign up on the webpage before they have access to a profile/dashboard
On the homepage, there has to be a sort of greeting, based on time, like Hello good morning {Name} then maybe a random quote.
Also, there has to be a categorized format for courses, in sections.Data analysis: introduction to Data, complete intermediate package...view allContent Writing: introduction to content writing, complete intermediate package...view allProduct Management: introduction to Product Management, complete intermediate package...view allDesign: introduction to Design, complete intermediate package...view all
